# Text sentiment analysis - Neural Network implemented without pyTorch, Tensorflow 
During a deepdive study into the algorithms running behind Deep Learning Frameworks like pyTorch and Tensorflow, I have implemented a Neural Network without using any popular frameworks. 

## Approach
The neural net is built upon just numpy and YES it can be done. This is not encouraging the building of model from groundup for normal projects. pyTorch and Tensorflow does improves development speed and the heart of data science.

## Download
Clone the GitHub repository and run jupyter notebooks
```
git clone https://github.com/victorywwong/sentiment-analysis-without-framework.git
```
